This is my new personal portfolio. I wanted to try Flask for something and this is the perfect project for that. <br>
The site will have following views: <br>
        - Front page containing picture and some introduction <br>
        - Projects page containign all relevant developer projects <br>
        - Contact page that has a simple form to contact me <br>
        - Maybe a blog page? <br>
