This is my new personal portfolio. I wanted to try Flask for something and this is the perfect project for that.
The site will have following views:
    - Front page containing picture and some introduction
    - Projects page containign all relevant developer projects
    - Contact page that has a simple form to contact me 
    - Maybe a blog page?
